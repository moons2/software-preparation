# Big O

Language and metric used to discribe the efficiency of and algorithm.

### An analogy

What if you have to deliver a file to a friend who lives crossing the country, how would you choose to deliver this file as fast as possible? Maybe one possible answer would be a transfer throuht the internet, but is this the right answer for every cases? The answer is not. If the file is very large it can take days to complete its transference, this way to travel may be a better choice if the time is the most important key.

### Time complexity

asymptotic runtime.

> Eletric transfer: O(s), s beeing the size of the file. This means the transfertime increses linearly with s

> Airplane Transfer: O(1), no matter the file's size, the time to transfer it will be constant.
