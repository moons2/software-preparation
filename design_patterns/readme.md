# Design Patterns

Software life-cycle phases

1. REQUIREMENTS
2. DESIGN
3. CONSTRUCTION

Design Phase is the most challenging phase, there is no algorithm for deriving software design form requirements.

	**Design Patterns (DP)**: offer reusable pattern solutions to reocurring design problems.
	DP map design problems to general solutions


**Requirements** are written from the **problem domain** perspective, while **DP** solve problems that arise at **solution domain**.
